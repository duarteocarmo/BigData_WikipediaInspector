## Welcome to my solution for the first challenge, aka: 'WIKI_DESTROYER'

As you might have noticed by know, in this website I will try to explain a little bit how my solution works. 

Thanks for taking the time. This was hard, and I did it alone: bad idea. Here we go. 

### Part 1: Indexing and Cleaning at the same time. 

So, once I decompressed the bz2 file, I got a **huge** xml file that I could not even open. To tackle this, I managed to get an idea of what it looked like. 

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/duarteocarmo/WIKIPEDIA/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
